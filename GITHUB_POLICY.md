PARENTS FOR SCOUTING, INC. (PFSI) will use GitHub as a controlled collaboration platform for software and documentation. All GitHub usage will align with Scouting America digital safety and youth protection expectations for online activities and communications, including avoiding private one-on-one adult/youth communication channels and ensuring appropriate adult oversight. PFSI will prohibit storage of youth personal data and credentials in GitHub, enforce 2FA and least-privilege access, and maintain auditable workflows through pull-request review and controlled permissions.
